                            <h3>PANDA</h3>
    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),[5] also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear[6] native to South Central China.[1] It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.[7] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food</p>
     <p><For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons.[19] However, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae.[6][20] These studies show it diverged about 19 million years ago from the common ancestor of the Ursidae;[21] it is the most basal member of this family and equidistant from all other extant bear species.[22][21] The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil/p>

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.[10] As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.</p>
