    <p>This new addition to the V&A Waterfront is becoming a welcomed part of the calabash of cuisine options available at the seaside shopping mall. Housed in the old Hildebrand building, the setting was designed to reflect the natural beauty of its surrounds. You get a specular sweeping view of the Atlantic Ocean on the one side, but youâ€™re also treated to an eyeful of the iconic Table Mountain on the other side.</p>
     <p>A restaurant, or, more informally, an eatery, is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers. Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services.</p>
